The best people, they’re afraid, they question themselves. Many, if you corner them, will admit that they wonder if they’re good enough.

SCORE. Then we created a list of every rock-climbing store offline and online in Canada. 1. Search Google for “rock climbing Vancouver” or search “rock climbing” on Yelp. 2A. Go to websites listed and get the owner’s name (if possible), email, and phone number. OR 2B. Hire someone on Fiverr.com or Craigslist to go through every listing and add them on a sheet. And we messaged them, too."},{"title":"MILLION DOLLAR WEEKEND: THE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE WAY TO LAUNCH A 7-FIGURE BUSINESS IN 48 HOURS","author":"by Noah Kagan","note":"Now let’s get a list of marketing strategies you can do.

At Mint, we focused on personal finance bloggers and tech professionals. At AppSumo, our customer is Marketing Agency Matt, who is a solopreneur.

Where: North America/Canada, belong to a rock-climbing gym, purchase things from sporting goods stores, read Outside magazine, are fans of Alex Honnold (the free soloist climber), are in meetups/online groups to talk about climbers, watch specific YouTubers who teach new climbing techniques, and eat energy food like CLIF Bars."},{"title":"MILLION DOLLAR WEEKEND: THE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE WAY TO LAUNCH A 7-FIGURE BUSINESS IN 48 HOURS","author":"by Noah Kagan","note":"There’s a golden rule to marketing tactics I want you to repeat after me: Find what works and double down on it; find what doesn’t work and kill it."},{"title":"MILLION DOLLAR WEEKEND: THE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE WAY TO LAUNCH A 7-FIGURE BUSINESS IN 48 HOURS","author":"by Noah Kagan","note":"This will help you think of ways you can overdeliver to your current customers.

This Dream Year isn’t just “I’m gonna have a nice house and my business will rock it.” Include the specifics—where you’re living, what you’re doing, how you feel, where you travel to, etc. This is to inspire you about all the things you can do in your life. Then really dial in the ones that feel important to you. I’ve found it also helps me dream bigger: “Hot damn, I can do all these inspiring things!”"},{"title":"MILLION DOLLAR WEEKEND: THE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE WAY TO LAUNCH A 7-FIGURE BUSINESS IN 48 HOURS","author":"by Noah Kagan","note":"Now that you have created your Dream Year, it’s time to take your dreams and choose and organize them into your goals. This is your life, so PICK the things from your dream list you’re MOST excited about. Another key thing is consistency—it’s a GOOD thing if you’re continuing goals from previous years. Also, I prefer to have fewer things to accomplish but I’m very excited to do them. Categorize them into four sections: Work, Health, Personal, and Travel."},{"title":"MILLION DOLLAR WEEKEND: THE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE WAY TO LAUNCH A 7-FIGURE BUSINESS IN 48 HOURS","author":"by Noah Kagan","note":"The best way to make sure you accomplish your goals is to see them often.

We all have the same number of hours in a week, 168. How is it that some people get so much more done than others? With all the obligations like kids, community, day jobs, hobbies, and more in our lives, you must make sure to allocate time to things that matter. Show me YOUR calendar and I’ll tell you what’s most important to you. Since we’ve created your goals, we now take those items and place them in your calendar every week. Here’s my calendaring system: Put everything in a Category. Assign a Color Code to your categories. Schedule with color your key weekly priorities. Perform a weekly Sunday accountability (p)review. I’m not telling you how to spend your time—instead, I’m giving you the systems to make sure you’re allocating time toward your goals."},{"title":"MILLION DOLLAR WEEKEND: THE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE WAY TO LAUNCH A 7-FIGURE BUSINESS IN 48 HOURS","author":"by Noah Kagan","note":"Category and Color Code Here’s a pretty typical screenshot of my calendar showing my weekly schedule:"},{"title":"MILLION DOLLAR WEEKEND: THE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE WAY TO LAUNCH A 7-FIGURE BUSINESS IN 48 HOURS","author":"by Noah Kagan","note":"Blue = Work Green = Health Purple = Personal Yellow = Travel What color coding does is help me look at my calendar and instantly see: Am I spending my biggest blocks of time toward my goals?

Every Sunday, I spend fifteen minutes looking over the past week and setting my tasks for the next one. This is your chance to revisit your yearly goals and choose activities each week to move you closer toward your goals. 2. How do I know if these tasks are moving me in the right direction of my goal? During my Sunday review I also take my previous Sunday’s goals and see how I did against them. This is my chance to evaluate if it moved the needle toward my yearly goal. It’s not to judge or shame yourself, but to keep yourself accountable and continually improve. 3. What if I want to be lazy, do I need to schedule it? WWND: What Would Neville Do? Hell no. There are days just like Neville’s when you want to do nothing. Enjoy it. Use your laziness to your advantage. Are there parts of your work you can outsource, stop doing, or find software to do for you (maybe at a great price on AppSumo.com!)? 4. How can I double down on activities that move me toward my goals? Whichever activities you love or help you with your goals, put those on repeat. My motto: The more things that are on repeat, the better. If every Monday and Thursday you do three hours of YouTube work starting at one p.m., it becomes habitual. And every Tuesday night I go biking; it’s automatic. If the important tasks are automatically added, you free up your brain to focus on the more complex issues that give you energy and move you toward your goals. —"},{"title":"MILLION DOLLAR WEEKEND: THE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE WAY TO LAUNCH A 7-FIGURE BUSINESS IN 48 HOURS","author":"by Noah Kagan","note":"That’s why every Sunday for the past ten years I’ve sent my friend Adam Gilbert my Sunday (P)review email outlining everything I said I’d do last week, how much of it I accomplished, and everything I want to do in the week ahead."}]
