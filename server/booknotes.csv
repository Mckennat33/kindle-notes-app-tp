A terrible goal is “I want to be rich.” That’s totally meaningless. What’s the number? A better one is “I want to be worth $1 million.” There’s no time frame. And without a time frame, there’s no urgency. So what’s a goal we can work with? “I want to be worth $1 million in three years.”"},{"title":"MILLION DOLLAR WEEKEND: THE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE WAY TO LAUNCH A 7-FIGURE BUSINESS IN 48 HOURS","author":"by Noah Kagan","note":"Here’s my favorite way to ask for money: “Sign up now while it’s still at a discounted price, x percent of y dollars [and you’ll be grandfathered in at that price forever].

Really easy having a cool place when you’re loaded; not so easy, but possible, when your budget is tight. Idea: Interior designers are for rich people.
