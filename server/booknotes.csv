    "": "And here is a parable of life for you to ponder on: A group of tourists sits in a bus that is passing through gorgeously beautiful country; lakes and mountains and green fields and rivers. But the shades of the bus are pulled down. They do not have the slightest idea of what lies beyond the windows of the bus. And all the time of their journey is spent in squabbling over who will have the seat of honor in"

    "": "There is only one cause of unhappiness: the false beliefs you have in your head, beliefs so widespread, so commonly held, that it never occurs to you to question them."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Because of these false beliefs you see the world and yourself in a distorted way. Your programming is so strong and the pressure of society so intense that you are literally trapped into perceiving the world in this distorted kind of way."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "people are so brainwashed that they do not even realize how unhappy they are—like the man in a dream who has no idea he is dreaming."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "What are these false beliefs that block you from happiness? Here are some examples. First: You cannot be happy without the things that you are attached to and that you consider so precious."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "False. There is not a single moment in your life when you do not have everything that you need to be happy."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The reason why you are unhappy is because you are focusing on what you do not have rather than on what you have right now."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Another belief: Happiness is in the future. Not true. Right here and now you are happy and you do not know it because your false beliefs and your distorted perceptions have got you caught up in fears, anxieties, attachments, conflicts, guilt and a host of games that you are programmed to play."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Happiness will come if you manage to change the situation you are in and the people around you. Not true. You stupidly squander so much energy trying to rearrange the world. If changing the world is your vocation in life, go right ahead and change it, but do not harbor the illusion that this is going to make you happy."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "What makes you happy or unhappy is not the world and the people around you, but the thinking in your head."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Another false belief: If all your desires are fulfilled you will be happy. Not true. In fact it is these very desires and attachments that make you tense, frustrated, nervous, insecure and fearful."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",

  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "If you wish to attain to lasting happiness you must be ready to hate father, mother, even your own life and to take leave of all your possessions. How? Not by renouncing them or giving them up because what you give up violently you are forever bound to."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "But rather by seeing them for the nightmare they are; and then, whether you keep them or not, they will have lost their grip over you, their power to hurt you, and you will be out of your dream at last, out of your darkness, your fear, your unhappiness."

    "": "you. If the demands are met, the computer allows you to be peaceful and happy. If they are not met, even though it be through no fault of yours, the computer generates negative emotions that cause you to suffer. For instance, when other people don’t live up to your computer’s expectations, it torments you with frustration or anger or bitterness. Another instance: When things are not under your control or the future is uncertain, your computer insists that you experience anxiety, tension, worry. Then you expend a lot of energy coping with these negative emotions. And you generally cope by expending more energy trying to rearrange the world around you so that the demands of your computer will be met."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Now keep looking at this unpleasant situation or person until you realize that it isn’t they that are causing the negative emotions. They are just going their way, being themselves, doing their thing whether right or wrong, good or bad. It is your computer that, thanks to your programming, insists on your reacting with negative emotions."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "This is what happened: First your society and your culture taught you to believe that you would not be happy without certain persons and certain things."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Just take a look around you: Everywhere people have actually built their lives on the unquestioned belief that without certain things—money, power, success, approval, a good reputation, love, friendship, spirituality, God—they cannot be happy. What is your particular combination?"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "And here is something else to ponder on: Each time you are anxious and afraid, it is because you may lose or fail to get the object of your attachment, isn’t it?"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "And almost all your anger comes from someone standing in the way of your attachment, doesn’t it?"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "And every time you feel bored, isn’t it because you are not getting a sufficient supply of what you believe will make you happy, of what you are attached to?"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "And when you are depressed and miserable, the cause is there for all to see: Life is not giving you what you have convinced yourself you cannot be happy without."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Almost every negative emotion you experience is the direct outcome of an attachment."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "In order to be genuinely happy there is one and only one thing you need to do: get deprogrammed, get rid of those attachments."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "All you need to do is open your eyes and see that you do not really need the object of your attachment at all; that you were programmed, brainwashed into thinking that you could not be happy or you could not live without this particular person or thing."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Remember how heartbroken you once were, how you were certain you never would be happy again because you lost someone or something that was so precious to you? But then what happened? Time passed and you learned to get on pretty well, did you not? That should have alerted you to the falseness of your belief, to the trick your programmed mind was playing on you."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "An attachment isn’t a fact. It is a belief, a fantasy in your head, acquired through programming."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "your mind is creating unhappiness all the time."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Now if you look carefully, you will see that there is one thing and only one thing that causes unhappiness. The name of that thing is Attachment."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "An emotional state of clinging caused by the belief that without some particular thing or some person you cannot be happy."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Contrary to popular belief, dropping attachments is easy."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "see, the following truths. First truth: You are holding on to a false belief, namely, the belief that without this particular person or thing you will not be happy. Take your attachments one at a time and see the falseness of this belief. You may encounter resistance from your heart, but the moment you do see, there will be an immediate emotional result. At that very instant the attachment loses its force. Second truth: If you just enjoy things, refusing to let yourself be attached to them, that is, refusing to hold the false belief that you will not be happy without them, you are spared all the struggle and emotional strain of protecting them and guarding them for yourself."

    "": "The rich man cannot enter the kingdom of joy not because he wants to be bad but because he chooses to be blind."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Because the moment you cease to live up to my expectations, you will cease to be especial.”"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "To ask to be especial to someone means essentially to be bound to the task of making yourself pleasing to this person. And therefore to lose your freedom. Take all the time you need to realize this. Maybe now you are ready to say, “I’d rather have my freedom than your love.”"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "“I leave you free to be yourself …” In saying those words you have set yourself free. You are now ready to love. For when you cling, what you offer the other is not love but a chain by which both you and your beloved are bound. Love can only exist in freedom. The true lover seeks the good of his beloved which requires especially the liberation of the beloved from the lover."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Now take a look at yourself reacting negatively and ask yourself the following question: “Am I in charge of this situation or is this situation in charge of me?”"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "All you have to do is understand that there are people in the world who, if they were in your place, would not be negatively affected by this person."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The thing that is blind is not love but attachment."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "An attachment is a state of clinging that comes from the false belief that something or someone is necessary for your happiness."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Now think of yourself listening to an orchestra in which the sound of the drum is so loud that nothing else can be heard. To enjoy the symphony you must be responsive to every instrument in the orchestra. To be in the state called love you must be sensitive to the uniqueness and beauty of every single thing and person around you."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Who decides what will finally make its way to your conscious mind from all the material that is pouring in from the world? Three decisive filters: first your attachments, second your beliefs and third your fears."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "It is quite impossible, of course, to be fully conscious of every note in life’s symphony. But if your spirit becomes unclogged and your senses open you will begin to perceive things as they really are and to interact with reality and you will be entranced by the harmonies of the universe."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "It is only when you drop your beliefs, your fears and the attachments that breed them that you will be freed from the insensitivity that makes you so deaf and blind to yourself and to the world."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Think of the numerous times you were tossed about by your emotions, that you have suffered the pangs of anger, depression, anxiety, when in every instance it was because your heart became set on getting something that you did not have, or on holding on to something that you had, or on avoiding something that you did not want."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The first truth: You must choose between your attachment and happiness. You cannot have both."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The second truth: Where did your attachment come from? You were not born with it. It sprang from a lie that your society and your culture have told you, or a lie that you have told yourself, namely, that without this or the other, without this person or the other, you can’t be happy."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The third truth: If you wish to be fully alive you must develop a sense of perspective. Life is infinitely greater than this trifle your heart is attached to and which you have given the power to so upset you."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Trifle, yes, because if you live long enough a day will easily come when it will cease to matter. It will not even be remembered—your own experience will confirm this."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Just as today you barely remember, are no longer the least bit affected by those tremendous trifles that so disturbed you in the past."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "And so the fourth truth brings you to the unavoidable conclusion that no thing or person outside of you has the power to make you happy or unhappy."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Whether you are aware of it or not it is you and only you who decides to be happy or unhappy, whether you will cling to your attachment or not in any given situation."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "As you ponder these truths you may become aware that your heart is resisting them or argues against them and refuses to look at them. That is a sign that you have not yet suffered enough at the hand of your attachments to really want to do something about your spiritual radio."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Now look at a person or a thing you have an attachment for: someone or something to whom you have handed over the power to make you happy or unhappy."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "What are these layers? Every belief that you hold, every conclusion you have reached about persons and things, every habit and every attachment. In your formative years you should have been helped to scrape off these layers and liberate your mind. Instead your society, your culture, which put these layers on your mind in the first place, has educated you to not even notice them, to go to sleep and let other people—the experts: your politicians, your cultural and religious leaders—do your thinking for you."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "So you are weighed down with the load of unexamined, unquestioned authority and tradition."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Let us examine these layers one at a time. First your beliefs. If you experience life as a communist or a capitalist, as a Moslem or a Jew, you are experiencing life in a prejudiced, slanted way; there is a barrier, a layer of fat between Reality and you because you no longer see and touch it directly."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Do you see now how you are in a prison created by the beliefs and traditions of your society and culture and by the ideas, prejudices, attachments and fears of your past experiences?"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "What can you do to break out? Four things: First, realize that you are surrounded by prison walls, that your mind has gone to sleep."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Most people end up being conformists;"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Second, contemplate the walls, spend hours just observing your ideas, your habits, your attachments and your fears without any judgment and condemnation. Look at them and they will crumble."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Third, spend some time observing the things and people around you. Look, but really look, as if for the very first time, at the face of a friend, a leaf, a tree, a bird in flight, the behavior and mannerisms of the people around you. Really see them and hopefully you will see them afresh as they are in themselves without the dulling, stupefying effect of your ideas and habits."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The fourth and most important step: Sit down quietly and observe how your mind functions. There is a steady flow of thoughts and feelings and reactions there. Watch the whole of it for long stretches of time the way you watch a river or a movie."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "It is with charity as with happiness and holiness. It is not possible for you to say that you are happy because the moment you become conscious of your happiness you cease to be happy."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "What you call the experience of happiness is not happiness at all but the excitement and thrill caused by some person or thing or event."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "True happiness is uncaused. You are happy for no reason at all."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "And true happiness cannot be experienced. It is not within the realm of consciousness. It is unself-consciousness."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "effort can perform acts of service, it is powerless to produce love or holiness."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "All you can achieve by your effort is repression, not genuine change and growth."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Change is only brought about by awareness and understanding."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Understand your unhappiness and it will disappear—what results is the state of happiness."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Understand your fears and they will melt—the resultant state is love. Understand your attachments and they will vanish—the consequence is freedom. Love and freedom and happiness are not things that you can cultivate and produce."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "You cannot even know what they are. All you can do is observe their opposites and, through your observation, cause these opposites to die."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "If you desire happiness you will be anxious lest you do not attain it. You will be constantly in a state of dissatisfaction; and dissatisfaction and anxiety kill the very happiness that they set out to gain."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "that every time you strive to improve on Nature by going against it, you will damage yourself, for Nature is your very being."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "First: Think of some change that you wish to bring about in your life or in your personality. Are you attempting to force this change on your nature through effort and through the desire to become something that your ego has planned?"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "That is the serpent fighting the dove. Or are you content to study, observe, understand, be aware of your present state and problems, without pushing, without forcing things that your ego desires, leaving Reality to effect changes according to Nature’s plans, not yours?"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The animal is never overweight, never tense except before fight or flight. It never eats or drinks what is not good for it. It has all the rest and exercise that it needs. It has the right amount of exposure to the elements, to wind and sun and rain and heat and cold. That is because the animal listens to its body and allows itself to be guided by the body’s wisdom. Compare that with your own foolish cunningness."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Ask yourself how much you are in touch with Nature, with trees and earth and grass and sky and wind and rain and sun and flowers and birds and animals. How much are you exposed to Nature? How much do you commune with her, observe her, contemplate her in wonder, identify with her?"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The rose has a gift that you lack: It is perfectly content to be itself. It has not been programmed from birth, as you have been, to be dissatisfied with itself, so it has not the slightest urge to be anything other than it is."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Consider your sad condition. You are always dissatisfied with yourself, always wanting to change yourself. So you are full of violence and self-intolerance which only grows with every effort that you make to change yourself. So any change you achieve is always accompanied by inner conflict."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "And you suffer when you see others achieve what you have not and become what you are not."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "This is far from easy because to understand what you are requires complete freedom from all desire to change what you are into something else. You"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "If what you attempt is not to change yourself but to observe yourself, to study every one of your reactions to people and things, without judgment or condemnation or desire to reform yourself, your observation will be nonselective, comprehensive, never fixed on rigid conclusions, always open and fresh from moment to moment."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Since all change is violent she will be violent. But the marvelous quality of Nature-violence, unlike ego-violence, is that it does not spring from intolerance and self-hatred."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Look at your life and see how you have filled its emptiness with people. As a result they have a stranglehold on you."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "See how they control your behavior by their approval and disapproval. They hold the power to ease your loneliness with their company, to send your spirits soaring with their praise, to bring you down to the depths with their criticism and rejection."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Take a look at yourself spending almost every waking minute of your day placating and pleasing people, whether they are living or dead. You"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "People have become so much a part of your being that you cannot even imagine living a life that is unaffected or uncontrolled by them. As a matter of fact, they have convinced you that if you ever broke free of them, you would become an island—solitary, bleak, unloving. But the exact opposite is true. How can you love someone whom you are a slave to? How can you love someone whom you cannot live without? You can only desire, need, depend and fear and be controlled."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Love is to be found only in fearlessness and freedom. How do you achieve this freedom?"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "You must cultivate activities that you love."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "You must discover work that you do, not for its utility, but for itself. Think of something that you love to do for itself, whether it succeeds or not, whether you are praised for it or not, whether you are loved and rewarded for it or not, whether people know about it and are grateful to you for it or not. How many activities can you count in your life that you engage in simply because they delight you and grip your soul? Find them out, cultivate them, for they are your passport to freedom and to love."

]o I KNOW love tacos and pitched them the idea of a taco poster for $25. The responses I got . . . “Uh, so you want me to buy a print for $25 of a . . . taco? I’ll pass.” “Yeah, not my thing, Noah.” “No one loves tacos as much as you do.” Obviously, I was disappointed not even my close friends would buy a limited-edition taco print. Every time I got rejected, I’d ask the person my four questions. Why not? Who is one person you know who would really like this? What would make this a no-brainer for you? What would you pay for that?"

During my Sunday review I also take my previous Sunday’s goals and see how I did against them. This is my chance to evaluate if it moved the needle toward my yearly goal. It’s not to judge or shame yourself, but to keep yourself accountable and continually improve. 3. What if I want to be lazy, do I need to schedule it? WWND: What Would Neville Do? Hell no. There are days just like Neville’s when you want to do nothing. Enjoy it. Use your laziness to your advantage. Are there parts of your work you can outsource, stop doing, or find software to do for you (maybe at a great price on AppSumo.com!)? 4. How can I double down on activities that move me toward my goals? Whichever activities you love or help you with your goals, put those on repeat. My motto: The more things that are on repeat, the better. If every Monday and Thursday you do three hours of YouTube work starting at one p.m., it becomes habitual. And every Tuesday night I go biking; it’s automatic. If the important tasks are automatically added, you free up your brain to focus on the more complex issues that give you energy and move you toward your goals. —"
