    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Here's another example of how we live in a world of thought and not reality. If you walk up to 100 different people and ask each of them what money means to them, how many different answers do you think you'll get? Close to 100 different answers! Money is technically the same thing, but it means something different to each person."

    "": "The meaning (or thinking) we give an event is what determines how we ultimately feel about it. That meaning or thinking is the filter through which we see life from then on — because of this, we live through a perception of reality, not in reality itself. Reality is that the event happened, with no meaning, thinking, or interpretation of it. Any meaning or thinking we give the event is on us and that is how our perception of reality is created. This is how our experience of life is created from the inside out."

    "": "It's not about the events that happen in our lives, but our interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or bad about something."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Our feelings do not come from external events, but from our own thinking about the events. Therefore, we can only ever feel what we are thinking."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "If we know that we can only ever feel what we are thinking, then we know that we can change our feelings by changing our thinking. Thus, we can change our experience of life by knowing that it comes from our own thinking. And if that is true, then we are ever only one thought away from experiencing something different and transforming our entire lives at any moment — through a state of no thought."

It’s not the empty boat, but my reaction to it that causes my anger. All the people or situations that make me upset and angry are just like the empty boat. They don’t have the power to make me angry without my own reaction.”"

    "": "Thinking, on the other hand, is the act of thinking about our thoughts. This takes a significant amount of energy, effort, and willpower (which is a finite resource). Thinking is actively engaging with the thoughts in your mind. You don’t have to engage with each thought in your mind, but when you do, that is thinking. Thinking is the root cause of all our psychological suffering."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The moment we think about our thoughts is when we begin to get taken on an emotional rollercoaster. When we think about our thoughts, we begin to judge and criticize the thoughts and experience all sorts of internal emotional turmoil."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Thoughts create. Thinking destroys. The reason thinking destroys is because as soon as we begin to think about the thoughts, we cast our own limiting beliefs, judgements, criticisms, programming, and conditioning onto the thought, thinking of infinite reasons as to why we can’t do it and why we can’t have it."

  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "When you're experiencing a lot of frustration, stress, anxiety, or any negative emotions, just know that it is because you're thinking, and the intensity of those emotions is directly correlated to how much thinking is going on."

    "": "A tough, brawny samurai once approached a Zen master who was deep in meditation. Impatient and discourteous, the samurai demanded in his husky voice so accustomed to forceful yelling, “Tell me the nature of heaven and hell.” The Zen master opened his eyes, looked the samurai in the face, and replied with a certain scorn, “Why should I answer to a shabby, disgusting, despondent slob like you? A worm like you, do you think I should tell you anything? I can’t stand you. Get out of my sight. I have no time for silly questions.” The samurai could not bear these insults. Consumed by rage, he drew his sword and raised it to sever the master’s head at once. Looking straight into the samurai’s eyes, the Zen master tenderly declared, “That’s hell.” The samurai froze. He immediately understood that anger had him in its grip. His mind had just created his own hell — one filled with resentment, hatred, self-defense, and fury. He realized that he was so deep in his torment that he was ready to kill somebody."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The samurai’s eyes filled with tears. Setting his sword aside, he put his palms together and obsequiously bowed in gratitude for this insight. The Zen master gently acknowledged with a delicate smile, “And that’s heaven.”"

    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The most interesting and almost paradoxical thing about stopping our thinking is that we don't have to do anything to minimize it other than to be aware of it. By us becoming aware that we are thinking and that it is the root cause of all our suffering, it automatically makes us conscious to that fact and we become detached to it, allowing it to settle and pass. This takes almost no effort and is done through pure presence in the moment."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "This is how our minds also work. If we let our thinking sit without disturbing it by trying to \"filter\" or \"boil\" it, the thinking will settle down on its own and our minds will become free from thinking. The natural state of water is clear, and the natural state of our minds is also clear, if we do not disturb it."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "If life begins to feel unclear, disorganized, stressful and you're not sure what to do next, you now know that it's only because your thinking is stirring up the dirt, making your mind cloudy and difficult to see ahead. You can use this as an indicator to help you realize that you're thinking way too much."

    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Like everything in this world, there is nothing inherently good or bad, only our thinking makes it so."
  },

    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Goals, dreams, and ambitions are not good or bad, so it's not really an either-or situation, but more about where those goals are coming from."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "There are two sources of goals: goals created out of inspiration and goals created out of desperation."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "the goals we set in this state of desperation are all a means to an end."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Goals created from desperation are typically \"realistic\" and created from analyzing our past and what we think to be \"plausible\" in the moment. It feels very confining and limiting. Although these types of goals and dreams may excite us in the moment, as soon as we begin to try to create it, we feel a lack, and we are desperate to bring the dream to life. Paradoxically, if we do end up achieving a goal created out of desperation, we end up feeling even more empty than we did before it."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Goals and dreams that come in the form of thought are created out of inspiration. Goals and dreams"
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Moreover, we feel like we're trying to accomplish these goals to escape our current situation and get out of something. Our goals created in this state are typically means goals, meaning that we want to achieve these goals so that we can do something else afterwards, such as having the goal to quit our job."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "It just depends on the source of the goals and not necessarily the goal itself."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "We are not creating so that we can feel whole, but we are creating because we feel whole and want to give from that place, not expecting anything from it."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "If you look at children, they naturally have the wildest dreams and imaginations of what they want to do. It almost doesn't even register in their minds that they can't do something most of the time. The only difference between us and children is that we have learned to shut down all these thoughts of inspiration which contain our dreams, hopes, and goals that we truly want to see manifested in the world. Our minds are filled more with reasons of why we can't than thoughts of what we want to create."

    "": "I asked myself, did I love her because of her laugh or because she loves helping other people? What happens if she doesn't laugh one day or doesn't help someone that day? Do I stop loving her if she doesn't do the things that I said were the reasons that I love her? I realized that if I create reasons for why I love her, then it makes my love for her conditional to those specific traits or actions and if she doesn't do them, then I don't love her. This is, of course, not true."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Unconditional creation is the purest form of creation there is. When something is created from unconditional love, we can't help but to stand there and admire it in awe. Unconditional creation is always innovative, unique, new, captivating, bold, different, revolutionary in its own way. Very few people operate in this space because we always put conditions around what we do or make."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "What's paradoxical (like everything in the duality of life), is that when we create something without conditions or reasons, we actually immediately feel all of the positive feelings we want."

    "": "state of non-thinking. Our brains will make us think that it is pointless to do something just simply because we want to, but that is the secret. As soon as we do things for no other reason, we step into the realm of living our life unconditionally. This is when we experience flow, oneness, and a direct connection to the Universe/God."

    "": "Once you see that it is just your thinking and that there’s nothing to be afraid of, then you will experience true peace in your life in the present."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "There’s only thinking that give us pleasant or not so pleasant feelings. When we put things into a bucket of right or wrong, good or bad, this creates duality and conditions in our lives, which determines how we feel."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "If you're confronted with something that may stir up negative emotions, go within yourself to find the source of universal truth deep within your soul. If you try to look for the answers outside or try to dig into external reasons for the root of why you feel this way, you will be looking for the rest of eternity and will never find it."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Negative emotions are an indication of misunderstanding. When we are gripped by negative emotions, it means that we believe what we are thinking. It is in this moment that we simply forgot where our experience comes from and that our thinking is the cause of our negative emotions."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "All you have to do is remember that thinking is the root cause of how we’re feeling. Once this is brought into your awareness, don’t fight the thinking. Just become aware that it is your thinking that’s causing the ill feelings, welcome it with love, and it will slowly dissipate before your eyes. Not too long after, you’ll return to your natural state of peace, love, and joy."

  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Your intuition will always lead you to where you need to go and what you should do at any moment in time. It's like a real-time inner GPS that will tell you when to take a detour and which path you should take if there is a blockage in the road to your destination."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "It's guaranteed that our inner GPS will guide us to exactly where we want to go, but what’s not guaranteed is how or which path it will put us on to take us there."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Society will almost never confirm our intuition until it's mainstream already. For this reason, if you try to look outside for confirmation on what you know to be true for you, you'll almost always get backlash and differing opinions on what next steps you should take."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Avoid looking externally for answers. Follow your intuition, your gut feeling, your inner wisdom, and the Universe/God. When you do this, you will begin to see miracles occurring in your life that you never could have expected or even dreamed of."
  },

    "": "When you’re following your intuition, it means you are trusting yourself and having faith that you always have the inner wisdom necessary to help guide you through everything in life."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "When we realize that we don’t have to control and try to force everything to happen our way, we become free from suffering, pain, and frustration and begin to fall into this state of non-thinking where things just all happen for us instead of to us."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "It is true that we cannot control everything that happens in our lives, but what we can control is whether we think or not"

    "": "Our job is to come up with what we want, not how to get it."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "In summary, your intuition always knows what you need to do in the present moment, but the only way to access it is by getting into a state of non-thinking. Your personal mind will freak out because you’re stepping into the space of infinite possibilities (the unknown), but if you remember that it is just thinking that is making you feel fear, the fearful thinking will fall away and the courage you need to act on your intuition will naturally surface."
  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The fear is only present as long as your thinking is revolving around fear. Once you acknowledge the fear and understand that it’s only your thinking that’s causing those feelings, the illusion will fall apart, and you’ll fall back into peace, joy, and pure love."

  },
  {
    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "The way we can create this space is through non-thinking. As soon as we stop our strenuous efforts to think, we immediately create space where new thoughts and ideas can enter our minds. Questions that challenge our current way of thinking are also a great way to create space in our minds."

    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "Thinking is the root cause of all suffering. There is no other answer to why we feel negative emotions other than that it is from our own thinking. Everything can be traced back to our thinking, which makes problem solving very simple. Once we realize that our thinking is causing how we feel, we can let go of it and we return to our natural state of peace, love, and joy. When we let go of our thinking, it creates space for us to be able to allow all positive emotions we want to feel to surface from within us. We don’t live in reality, we live in a PERCEPTION of reality, which is created by our own thinking. Thinking is NOT an effect of our experiences, but the CAUSE of it. The thoughts in our minds are not facts. Our thinking only has control over us if we believe it. Let go of the belief in the thought to let go of the suffering. Our feelings are direct feedback and an innate internal guidance system to let us know whether we are lacking understanding or have absolute clarity of truth. Feelings are an invitation to deepen our understanding of the truth."

    "": "We are in flow when we are not thinking. There is no separation between us and the Universe and all of life when we are not thinking. It is only when we think that we cut ourselves from Source and feel separate from all things (the birth of the ego). Thinking and thoughts are two different things. Thinking is a verb and requires our manual effort, which causes suffering. Thoughts are nouns, which do not come from us and are divine downloads from the Universe. We think because it is a biological response to survive. Our minds think only because it is trying to keep us alive, but it does not help us thrive. It is only concerned with our safety and survival, but not our fulfillment. Thinking holds us back from our Highest Selves by causing negative feelings within us that prevent us from following our true callings. Our minds are limited to our personal experiences. If you want to receive insights, creativity, and knowledge beyond the capabilities of your current self, simply choose to listen to Infinite Intelligence rather than your finite mind. This infinite source of truth is available to all people at all times if we allow it to be. Universal Intelligence/Mind is the energy that is everything in this universe. It is the source of where everything comes from that is before form and we are made up of it. This energy has a feeling, which is the feeling of"
