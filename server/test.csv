    "": "FEAR OF ASKING. Soon after starting, the fear of rejection emerges. You have some impressive skills, an amazing product, every advantage in the world, and you’ll never sell a thing if you can’t face another person and ask for what you want. Whether you want them to buy what you’re selling or help in another way, you have to be able to ask in order to get. Once you reframe rejection as something desirable, the act of asking becomes a power all its own."

    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "From now on, everything you do in this book, and after, should be viewed as an experiment. This has been a profound shift for people who worry that “starting a business” is this big daunting thing. Experiments are supposed to fail. And should they fail, you just take what you’ve learned and try again a little bit differently."

    "Your Kindle Notes For:": "Highlight (Yellow)",
    "": "That we eventually succeeded is a byproduct of the fact that we just try more things, period. That’s what I call Creator’s Courage. I believe everyone is born with this courage, and for those who have lost it, this book will help you rediscover the ability to come up with ideas (starting) and have the courage to try them out (asking)."

That meant starting small, starting fast, and not worrying about what I didn’t know. I became an expert at taking leaps. Being unafraid to start new things meant that, unlike most people, I was constantly conducting experiments in my personal and professional lives, in both big and small ways. New industries. New hobbies. New technologies. New roles. New people. New side hustles. That’s where I found my superpower, which taught me a lesson I want to pass on to you: focus above all else on being a starter, an experimenter, a learner."

Everyone around him kept saying, “I want to cut down on coffee, too.” But no one was quitting coffee—because there was nothing better to drink! Then Shane went to India and discovered masala chai. Shane loved it: It tasted great and gave him a small caffeine kick. But it didn’t make him feel like a vibrating wreck like coffee did. So Shane invented Mud/Wtr. His Mud is a masala chai coffee replacement with other ingredients for added health benefits."

What is one thing that I regularly fail to do well? What is one thing I wanted to buy recently only to find out that no one made it?"

Really easy having a cool place when you’re loaded; not so easy, but possible, when your budget is tight. Idea: Interior designers are for rich people. This business would be much simpler (and less expensive): I send someone a photo of my place, giving my preferences, and they put together a Pinterest page of suggestions for me."

    "": "4. Search Engine Queries It’s much easier to sell something when people ALREADY want it. There are 3 billion Google searches every day, giving you a direct line to customers’ thoughts and needs. To access these thoughts, you’ll want to work backwards from a problem people want solved (a query) toward a solution they may be willing to pay for. Done right, this method is so effective that there are now search listening tools that make this even easier (like AnswerThePublic.com, which will find the most googled questions around whatever keyword you input)."

To figure out which questions are more likely to result in a successful business, ask yourself: Is the potential solution a vitamin (a nice-to-have) or a painkiller (a must-have)?"

When I was starting my Ninja discount card at UC Berkeley, there were only 25,000+ students on campus, and I was confident I could sell my discount card for $10. At best this could be a $250,000 business only if I was PERFECT. If I expanded to all the major college campuses in California, I could reach a student market of 1 million. It was clear this could easily create a million-dollar business. Here are the major things you’re looking for: Pick a price point you think will be ideal for your customer. Multiply that by the number of ideal customers. Does that equal at least a million dollars? Yes or no? Simple!"

I always give the same advice: “Your plan is to make money!” Realistically you’re not going to get 5 or 10 percent of this market, BUT now let’s see what it would take to generate your own $1 million in profit. Revenue – Cost = Profit. These determine if you can make your first million dollars."

That meant: Target profit $ 1,000 Profit per unit sold $ 5 Total sales needed 200 Two hundred bags of jerky in twenty-four hours?! Oof, too many sales in too little time! After I realized that I’d never make my Sumo Jerky goal selling one-off deliveries, I went back to the drawing board. That got me thinking of other businesses I launched, like my conference series, CommunityNext. Back when I was in the conference business, I started by selling individual tickets, which worked but required tons of effort. That stumped me until I thought, Oh, I can make a lot more money just selling package sponsorships to companies, who can then hand out tickets to employees or customers. That in turn got me thinking about the equivalent of sponsorships in the jerky world. How do I do bigger deals per transaction? What about a subscription service? If I could sell subscriptions, I could dramatically cut the number of sales I needed to make. If they were all three-month subscriptions, I’d need to sell only 67. And six-month? Only 33."

Or maybe one feature of your offer turns out to be the thing people want. Just keep your eyes open for adjacent opportunities. The easiest way for me to reach my goal was to increase the average order value by selling longer-term subscriptions to businesses."

Frequency: Increase how often someone will buy your service. Price point: Increase or decrease your price point to affect total sales. Customer type: Approach a more lucrative/wealthier customer segment. Product line: Add additional products to make the business more attractive to start. Add-on services: If you’re selling a product like cookies, can you offer a service like setting up birthday parties or cooking at the person’s home?"

Limitations breed creativity. Having a tight time limit will cut off the doubting wantrepreneur inside you and force you to iterate fast and be creative until you find something that works. Get your first three customers. Your first customer is a friend, the second customer is someone in your family, but your third customer is HARD. You think this is easy? Then get three customers. Don’t worry about building a business, we are ONLY validating your idea. And if it’s this hard now, it’ll ONLY get harder. Collect money up front. The promise of payment is not validation. That’s polite rejection. Getting customers to hand over their dollars makes it real. But you need to get real money, from real people.

But that’s exactly what you want to know! “Who is one person you know who would really like this?” Always, always, always ask for a referral! Be specific about what kind of referral and use a number; this makes it highly effective. “What would make this a no-brainer for you?” If they don’t want your product, maybe they’d want something related to it. If they don’t want to pay for your dog care app, what about dog walking? A dog hotel? Dog dating? “What would you pay for that?” One of the hardest things in a startup is setting prices.

During my Sunday review I also take my previous Sunday’s goals and see how I did against them. This is my chance to evaluate if it moved the needle toward my yearly goal. It’s not to judge or shame yourself, but to keep yourself accountable and continually improve. 3. What if I want to be lazy, do I need to schedule it? WWND: What Would Neville Do? Hell no. There are days just like Neville’s when you want to do nothing. Enjoy it. Use your laziness to your advantage. Are there parts of your work you can outsource, stop doing, or find software to do for you (maybe at a great price on AppSumo.com!)? 4. How can I double down on activities that move me toward my goals? Whichever activities you love or help you with your goals, put those on repeat. My motto: The more things that are on repeat, the better. If every Monday and Thursday you do three hours of YouTube work starting at one p.m., it becomes habitual. And every Tuesday night I go biking; it’s automatic. If the important tasks are automatically added, you free up your brain to focus on the more complex issues that give you energy and move you toward your goals. —"
